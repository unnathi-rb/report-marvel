# Task 1: Terraform
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code(IaC) tool, it lets us mange infrastructure using Configuration files rather then using Graphic UI on several platforms. This task was to create,manage and destroy infrastructure in AWS using Terraform.By creating terraform filesusig HCL and running them using CLI, i was able to create and delete infrastructure in AWS.

# Task 2: SSH
SSH- Secure Shell is used to connect to a server over the network.It is safe method to connect to an external server on the local device.
This task was to create a server and use ssh to find all th key files concerned with that server. Then copy all the files from there to a new server. I searched for all private keys,public keys and authorized keys in the first server and stored them in a file, then I ssh into other server and transferred the file into that.

# Task 3: Docker


# Task 4: Hashing
Hashing is a method of converting an input(int or string of char) into another string of values obtained using a Hash function. It prevents easy hacking of confidential infomation becoz a hashed string cannot be 
reversed into orginal data. In this task I used the hashlib python library to hash the passwords, the hashed passwords are stored with usernames in a dictionary.During login, the password verification is easily done by applying the same hash function to the input in password field. I have used SHA-256 hash function.
