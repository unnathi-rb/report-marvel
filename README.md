API 
By doing this task, I understood the use of APIs and how we can build and customize an application using a relevant API key from a provider.
I have created an application to get major details about any movie just by providing the title. I have used the API key from omdb api provider.
For programming , I used Javascript and added frontend features using html and css.

Kaggle contest
Kaggle is a platform for data science and machine learning professionals, on which users can compete with each other to create the best models for solving specific problems.This task was to compete in a competition on kaggle,it involved the creative problem solving combined with coding concepts. I studied the data sheet and tried to figure out all the factors that could affect the possibility of survival in the titanic Shipwreck. I used python with advanced features of panda and scikit-learn. I also used the XGBoost which allows the use of decision trees to predict the possibilities.I had to figure out the ways to improve the ways of increasing the efficiency of the ML model.The prediction model considers major factors like age, deck location,gender, fare and the class of passengers.

Pandas and Matplotlab
The panda and matplotlab features of python used in representing the data set and statistics.I used these features to plot a graph to depict the common bill amounts of a restaurant. This visual representation though matplotlab helps in easy understanding the data set and drawing conclutions through statistics.

Portfolio webpage
I created a personal portfolio website using html and css. It was an oppurtunity to work with full creativity.

Article using markdown
I wrote an intresting article about digital twin using markdown markup language.I used the features of headings , subheadings ,bolding the text and more.

Tinkercad
In this task,i designed a circuit where an ultrasonic sensor combined with a servo motor will act as a radar covering a wider region. As soon as the object is away from the range of sensor the servo motor is initiated and it rotates to help in detection of obstacles over a larger area.Through this task i learnt the basics of tinkercad, how to select elements of circuit,design and stimulate the circuit.

Speed control of DC motor
In this task, I built a circuit to control speed of a DC motor using a potentiometer. An Arduino board,a motor,a motor driver,a battery and a potentiometer.

LED Toggle using ESP32
Through this task , I learnt about the ESP32 and used it to control LED. Used the Arduino IDE to upload the code to program the ESP32.

Soldering
It was simple task where I learnt how soldering is a simple process of joing metal peices using a filler meterial called solder.Got to know the basics of soldering, the meterial used,soldering temperature, safety requirements,etc. I soldered an LED and a resitor onto a perf board.

Karnaugh Maps and Deriving the logic circuit
K map is graphical technique of simplifying Boolean expressions.In this task we used the k map concepts to program an alarm buzzer to beep when a theif breaks into a place. Intially wrote the logic using kmap and then designed a circuit on tinkercad and stimulated it.

Sad servers
It was a hands on experience working with linux commands.Sad servers is a software that offers services for improving debugging skills.Command line murders was like solving a murder mystery,I navigated into several directories and files to find clues and solve the mystery , all while using the command lines.

Datasheet Report writing
I wrote a report on L293D Motor driver.Learnt a lot about this IC ,it has a capacity to control two DC motors at a time.wrote a report about this using markdown.


555 oscillator
555 oscillator is a relaxation ossilator used for generating square wave forms.They can be used to create clock signals and time delays.In this task, a circuit with a 555 IC is used with resisters and capacitors to create an ossilator.An oscillospcope is used to observe the wave forms.

Active participation
I took part in the Kagada 20- a Technical student conference conducted by IEEE UVCE.I participated in poster presentation competation , made a poster on Microbots in neurosurgery.
