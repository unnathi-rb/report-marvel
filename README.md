# TASK 1: API 
The task was to create a user interface using API.
By doing this task, I understood the use of APIs and how we can build and customize an application using a relevant API key from a provider.
I have created an application to get major details about any movie just by providing the title. I have used the API key from OMDb API provider.
For programming , I used Javascript and added frontend features using html and css.

# TASK 3: Kaggle contest
Kaggle is a platform for data science and machine learning professionals, on which users can compete with each other to create the best models for solving specific problems.
This task was to compete in a competition on kaggle named Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster. It involved the creative problem solving combined with coding concepts. I studied the data sheet and tried to figure out all the factors that could affect the possibility of survival in the titanic Shipwreck.The prediction model considers major factors like age, deck location,gender, fare and the class of passengers.

##### Few new concepts learnt while finding ways to improve efficiency of the ML model:
- Python with advanced features of panda and scikit-learn.
  - Scikit-learn: An advanced library in python. Here it is used to split the data and cross validate the possibilities.
  - Panda: Used the panda library to read and store information avaliable in Data frames. Also used for categorizing age into bins.
- XGBoost which allows the use of decision trees to predict the possibilities.

# TASK 4: Portfolio webpage
The task was to create a personal portfolio website.
I created the portfolio website using html and css.It includes serveral information about my education, projects etc. It was an oppurtunity to work with full creativity.
Link for the website:

# TASK 5: Article using markdown
I wrote an intresting article about digital twin using markdown markup language.Digital twin is useful tool in manufacturing, helps in preprocessing and designing equipments.
I learnt and used the features of headings, subheadings, bold text and adding images in markdown.
Link for the repository:

# TASK 6: Tinkercad
In this task,I designed a circuit where an ultrasonic sensor combined with a servo motor will act as a radar covering a wider region.Components of the circuit were an Arduino UNO R3, Ultrasonic sound sensor and a servo motor.As soon as the object is away from the range of sensor the servo motor is initiated and it rotates to allow detection of obstacles over a larger area. 
Through this task i learnt the basics of tinkercad, how to select elements of circuit,design and stimulate the circuit. Dsigning a circuit in tinker and checking its effective functioning can be a useful method to get a blueprint to work with actual hardware components.
