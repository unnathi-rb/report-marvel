# TASK 1: Version Control
In this task i understood the working of git as a version control. Using git commands we intialize a directory as a git repository after which any commit we make can we stored in git for future refrences.The same can we done for a GitHub repository.Git commands:
- git init: intializing repository
- git add: staging changes
- git commit -m " ": to commit the changes
- git branch: to create new branch of the repo.
- git merge: merging a branch with main
- git revert HEAD: to revert(delete) the previous commit.
- git cherry-pick: to choose and apply a specific commit to another branch.
- git log: to view the history of commits made.

# TASK 4: Database task: DynamoDB
In this task I created a user login system that validates the username and passwords of users.
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service provided by AWS DynamoDB is a durable, secure data base. I have used Nodejs as backend and then connected it to AWS by Access key ID and secret access key.After this i created a table in DynamoDB for storing the user credentails. Later I used the bcrypt, a password hashing sysytem for security, through this function only the hashed password is stored in database and not the orginal password and is uses slow hashing intentionally to make it harder to crack.Finally I integrated frontned using HTML.
