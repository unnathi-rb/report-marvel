# TASK 1: Version Control
In this task i understood the working of git as a version control. Using git commands we intialize a directory as a git repository after which any commit we make can we stored in git for future refrences.The same can we done for a GitHub repository.Git commands:
- git init: intializing repository
- git add: staging changes
- git commit -m " ": to commit the changes
- git branch: to create new branch of the repo.
- git merge: merging a branch with main
- git revert HEAD: to revert(delete) the previous commit.
- git cherry-pick: to choose and apply a specific commit to another branch.
- git log: to view the history of commits made.
